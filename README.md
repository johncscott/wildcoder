"Wild Coder"

I've developed Umbraco for many's a year,
And I've spent no money on licenses here
And now I'm returning with gold in great store,
And I never will play the wild coder no more

And it's no X.S.L.T.!
and no version 4
so in my Umbraco,
just razor for sure

I went to an agent I used to frequent,
And I told the recruiter my money was spent
He asked me for razor, I answered him, "Nay",
Saying, "Custom Controllers aren't needed, no way"

And it's no X.S.L.T.!
and no version 4
so for me in Umbraco,
just razor for sure

I comit to my repo for ten hard days and nights,
And when I compile it my errors do fright
I said, "We must upgrade 7.4 is the best,
And the words that I told you were only in jest"

And it's no X.S.L.T.!
and no version 4
so for me in Umbraco,
just razor for sure

I'll go to my dev team, we'll have a big scrum
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they have kicked me as oft-times before,
I never will write XSLT no more

And it's no X.S.L.T.!
and no version 4
so for me in Umbraco,
just razor for sure
