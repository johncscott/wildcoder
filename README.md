Song

The wild rover is a traditional Irish song sung everywhere for St Patricks day (original below). I am updating it for Umbraco. This is my first draft. Please tweet @johncscott any lines you think could be better, or commit versions here.


"Wild Coder"

I've developed Umbraco for many's a year,
And I've spent no money on licenses here
And now I'm returning with gold in great store,
And I never will play the wild coder no more

And it's no X.S.L.T.!
and no version 4
so in my Umbraco,
just razor for sure

I went to an agent I used to frequent,
And I told the recruiter my money was spent
He asked me for razor, I answered him, "Nay",
Saying, "Custom Controllers aren't needed, no way"

And it's no X.S.L.T.!
and no version 4
so for me in Umbraco,
just razor for sure

I comit to my repo for ten hard days and nights,
And when I compile it my errors do fright
I said, "We must upgrade 7.4 is the best,
And the words that I told you were only in jest"

And it's no X.S.L.T.!
and no version 4
so for me in Umbraco,
just razor for sure

I'll go to my dev team, we'll have a big scrum
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they have kicked me as oft-times before,
I never will write XSLT no more

And it's no X.S.L.T.!
and no version 4
so for me in Umbraco,
just razor for sure

"Wild Rover"

I've been a wild rover for many's a year,
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer
And now I'm returning with gold in great store,
And I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no, nay, never!
No nay never no more
And I'll play the wild rover,
No never no more

I went to an alehouse I used to frequent,
And I told the landlady my money was spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay",
Saying, "Custom like yours I can have any day"

And it's no, nay, never!
No nay never no more
And I'll play the wild rover,
No never no more

I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright,
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She said, "I have whiskeys and wines of the best,
And the words that I told you were only in jest"

And it's no, nay, never!
No nay never no more
And I'll play the wild rover,
No never no more

I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done,
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they have kissed me as oft-times before,
I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no, nay, never!
No nay never no more
And I'll play the wild rover,
No never no more
